# Discord Open Redirect (Unpatched) 

First of all I would like to state that I didn't find this vulnerability, I only noticed that was exploited in the wild 

How I realized about the vulnerability.
A friend of mine received the typical message of free nitro that we have all received at some point. 
He contacted me in the DM to tell me if it was real or spam message. I warned him in advance that it was spam, but he made me curious and I decided to investigate it. To receive the nitro you have to add a bot to your server so I decided to add it to another account in a different server. When I added the bot I realized that your url is automatically redirected to another malicious website, which looked like the typical Discord phishing website. This was where I realized the vulnerability and I said "oh how strange" it has been automatically directed to the phishing website. Next, we are going to analyze the url to see the open redirect.



## Analysis :

```javascript
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1022148663725801502&permissions=8&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Ffnomm.com%2Fnekotina&response_type=code&scope=identify%20guilds.join%20bot
```
First we have the client_id which is not important
```
client_id=1022148663725801502
```
Then the permissions of the bot Here we can see that it is an 8 which is Administrator permissions on the Discord server
```
permissions=8
```
Open Redirect:
Then in the url we have the following redirect uri parameter that has the encoded url of the malicious web
```
redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Ffnomm.com
```
URL decoded would look like this
```
https://fnomm.com
```
The rest of the link is to add the bot and send an automatic message to everybody on the server with the same free nitro link.

## Report to the program bug bounty:
Once the URL was analyzed, I proceeded to send the report to the Discord bug bounty program, explaining what was mentioned above.

In the report I also attached a proof of concept video.

A positive point of the Discord bug bounty program is that they replied on the same day I reported it.

The negative point is that the program considered that it is social engineering and they closed the report as informative since they considered that it is not a vulnerability and that it was outside the scope of the program. Lastly, I would like to add that it is good that they have bug bounty programs however CSRF is out of scope, and social engineering is totally out of scope. 
I am not saying that it does not have to be because, in the end, phishing could be done of everything.In this particular case you are talking about an error that brings the user to a fake Discord page. Let's be honest, users are not going to notice that the url changes to another malicious one, because first they had already seen that it is a discord.com url. To sum up, I think it's not a question of whether or not it's a vulnerability, just making the final user more secure by applying a measure. Thx for reading, happy hunting ðŸ˜Ž
